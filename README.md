### Reflection


 Richard's Reflection - Overall it was a great experience working on this project, putting to work our ability to learn something completely new and make a working product in a short amount of time. TypeScript had it's own individual challenges at first but after spending countless hours with the nitty gritty, overall I can say that I can finally see TypeScripts usefullness (and annoyance) with making sure every single thing passed down is the data type you expect it to be.
