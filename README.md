### Reflection

Jasmyn's Refections - Learning and implementing both Typescipt and React Hooks for the first time was an excellent challenge. I appreciated our groups relaxed way of working together and accommodating each others' ideas. I was especially grateful when I had some family things come up and Lindsay and Richard picked up slack for me. We spent long days and nights working and troubleshot hundreds of error messages. What a great intro to Typescript!

Lindsay's Reflection - Ultimately, our stretch tech goal was to learn TypeScript. It started out pretty rough, but in hindsight I think we all learned a few lessons. The most impactful being that consistency is key. That being said, we also practiced and learned so much more than TypeScript. We were able to self-teach and implement React Hooks, solidify our understanding of Router, and explore things that we hadn't had the chance to a bit deeper. Our flexible group dynamic made learning everything and applying our new knowledge a good experience. 

Richard's Reflection - Overall it was a great experience working on this project, putting to work our ability to learn something completely new and make a working product in a short amount of time. TypeScript had it's own individual challenges at first but after spending countless hours with the nitty gritty, overall I can say that I can finally see TypeScripts usefullness (and annoyance) with making sure every single thing passed down is the data type you expect it to be.
